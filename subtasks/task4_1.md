## Task Description

You all must be aware of the quadruped robots, like the MIT Cheetah, STANFORD DOGGO, etc. A good leg design is the key to achieving a stable configuration of such robots.

> Let the Titan rise.

So your task is to make a leg design for a Quadruped robot. Not only does this end here, but you also have to complete the analysis for the permissible stress, strain, and safety factor for every part of the leg and this has to be done in ANSYS. After this is done, the results need to be properly documented. 

Hint :
You need to analyze the forces acting on each leg link and draw its FBD. The leg configuration can be whatever you wish. 

### TASK COMPLETION GUIDELINES: 

1. You are free to use any CAD software. (eg. SOLIDWORKS, FUSION 360, ONSHAPE, etc.) Just make sure that you are using the licensed version of the same. No unauthorized use of the software is permitted, and if done, the team will suffer a penalty for the entire TASK 4.  
2. Both the leg links should not be more than 400 mm, and the leg can have a maximum of 3 degrees of freedom.
3. Assign a suitable material to the leg parts.
4. The final documentation must contain the following things, and the documentation should follow the template given below:
    * The 4 views of the assembly are the front view, the Top view, the side view, and the isometric view.
    * The dimensional drawing of each component (Those using SOLIDWORKS can directly use the drawing feature to generate the same).
    * The Free Body Diagram(FBD) of every part in use.
5. The use of any mechanism(such as the pantograph mechanism) will be appreciable and shall be considered for the final evaluation of the task.

### SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:
1. You have to document your work in a structured format provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B0JHIPJWQeh7pIPiwNEHvlXUQZTnJ1anqGBXKie4ZXE/edit).
2. You have to fill in the required details in the document, with the proper images of the CAD files, and a working video of the model.
3. The images must include the following things: 
    1. The isometric view image of the leg design.
    2. The drawing files of the leg links that provide the link length and the diameters of the circles inscribed in that CAD model.
    3. The image of the FBD drawn, either using pen paper or with any online tool.
4. You are expected to explain the design, and justify the reason for that particular material selection(metal or non-metal). The evaluation will be done based on your level of understanding, your approach, as well as your documentation


You have to submit the zip file containing the documentation in the .pdf format and the video of the working model in the given form.
