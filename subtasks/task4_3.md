# Embedded Task

This task involves implementing a system that reads a .txt file generated from Task 1 and performs actions based on the type of junction and turn detected. The system will use the SRA board to control LED blinking patterns and motor movements. Additionally, the system will use freeRTOS to control both the LED blinking patterns and motor movements concurrently.

## **Task Instructions:**

- Read the output text file output from Task 1.
- Detect a specified type of junction (e.g., only left junction) and turn (e.g., left turn).
- **Types of Junction**

```
					   |XX|	  <--- Mines/U-turn
					   |  |
			-----------    -------------    <---- plus junction
			-----------	   -------------		
                       |  |
                       |  |
         ______________|  |
 Only-->|   ______________|  <-- Only Left
 Right  |  |
        |  |
    ____|  |____
    ____    ____ <-- Plus
        |  |
        |  |
    ____|  |
    ____   | <-- Straight+Left
        |  |
        |  |_____
        |   _____ <-- Straight+Right
        |  |
        |  |
        |  |
        |  |

```

Line sensor placement:

```
                               |     |
                               |     |
                           ____|     |____
                           ____|     |____
                               |     |
                               |  6  |
                              1|2 3 4|5
```

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are the positions of the 4 line sensors and the 5th is for the IR sensor.

- Implement **LED blinking** according to the **junction type**:
    - Utilize the SRA board's 8 LEDs to display the blink pattern.
    - For only left junction: LEDs will blink in a pattern from right to left.    
    - For only right junction: LEDs will blink in a pattern from left to right.    
    - For right+straight or left+straight junction: LEDs will blink in a pattern where the lights at both ends (first and eighth LEDs) move towards the center.
    - For plus junction: All LEDs blink simultaneously (on and off).
    - For dead end: LEDs will blink in a stationary pattern, indicating the end of the path.

- Control **motor movement**s according to the detected **turn type** using the SRA board. 
    i.e 
    - For a left turn, the motors should turn left.
    - For a right turn, the motors should turn right.
    - For a right + straight junction,  the motors should continue to move straight.
    - For a left + straight junction, the motors should turn left.
    - For a plus junction, the motors should turn left.
    - For dead end, the motors should stop.
    
    (This is the basic application of Left-Follow Rule where in the bot prioritises Left Turn at each junction. The next priority is for going Straight and then least priority is given to the Right Turn.)
    
- Utilize freeRTOS to ensure parallel execution of LED blinking and motor control tasks.
