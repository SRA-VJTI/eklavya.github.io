## Description
   
Cooperative robots, or robots that work together in a collaborative manner, have a broad spectrum of applications and importance in today's world. These robots can be utilized in manufacturing to streamline production processes, enhance efficiency, and ensure consistent quality control. In healthcare, they can assist medical professionals by performing repetitive tasks or aiding in surgeries, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. In disaster response scenarios, cooperative robots can navigate through hazardous environments, gather information, and assist in search and rescue missions, minimizing human risk. Furthermore, in exploration missions, such as space exploration or deep-sea exploration, these robots can work together to gather data and explore environments that are inaccessible or dangerous for humans. The significance of cooperative robots lies in their ability to augment human capabilities, automate tedious tasks, and operate in environments where human presence may be limited or risky. They represent a transformative technology that is reshaping industries and opening up new possibilities for innovation and advancement.

## Task 
Your Task is to create a simulation of cooperative robots using the ROS2 Turtlesim package to perform the desired maneuver with three turtlesims exactly as described below.
   1. Turtle 1 should trace the path with red color,turtle2 with black and turtle3 with green color. 
   2. You need to trace the following equations with the help of turtlesims packages:  
       Y = 5cos(x) ,Y = 5sin(x).
   3. The Three turtlesims should not collide with each other,rather they should complete the given curves simultaneously.
   4. The first curve traced by turtle 1 should be in interval [0,2π],the second curve should be in [2π,4π] and the third  curve should in [4π,6π].
