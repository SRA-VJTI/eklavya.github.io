# Rebel Blueprints

## Mission Brief

In this mission, the **Padawans** are summoned to generate a **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for the PCB schematics and layouts they forged in the PCB Designing task. Worry not if you skipped the PCB Designing task — this mission stands on its own, young Padawan. This is no trivial duty—every resistor, capacitor, and IC must be accounted for. Only with a complete and accurate BOM can the Rebel Alliance proceed to manufacturing.
**If you have not done the PCB Designing task** here is your reference [Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RF4yw-MRR_ZKoP1AoHSOtmx7msi20Z3P) named `MiniMorse.kicad_sh` (KiCad needs to be installed to open the Schematic).

Each listed component must include a **valid galactic trade route** (purchase link)—sourced from trusted vendors like **Mouser, Digikey, LCSC**, or local systems like **Robu.in, KTRON**, or **Amazon India**. This ensures the supply ships deliver the exact modules needed for assembly without delay.

The BOM must be compiled and submitted in a **Google Sheet** or **Excel spreadsheet**, ready for command review. All hyperlinks should be clickable and clearly lead to the part used.

## Jedi Archives: BOM Structure

To construct the BOM holocron, each row must contain the following entries:

| Column | Galactic Description |
|--------|-----------------------|
| **Component Name** | e.g., `0805 resistor`, `LM741` |
| **Description** | e.g., `"5% tolerance, 10kΩ SMD resistor"` |
| **Quantity Used** | Total units used in the design |
| **Package/Footprint** | e.g., `0805`, `SOT-223` |
| **Purchase Link** | A direct hyperspace route to the exact part used, with matching specs and footprint |
| **Total Cost** | Total cost in INR |

## Hint from Master Yoda

> Use websites like **Mouser**, **DigiKey**, **Robu.in**, and **KTRON**. You can also filter by **package type** when selecting parts. Always **check the datasheets** to verify footprints before selecting the final component for the blueprint.

## Warnings from the High Council

- **Ensure Availability**: Only select components that are in stock and ready for delivery across the galaxy.
- **Match the Footprint**: The mechanical specs must align perfectly with the footprints used in the PCB layout. Incorrect footprints can cause droid malfunctions.
- **No Overpricing**: Avoid parts from the Outer Rim markets that are unnecessarily expensive unless absolutely essential.

## Final Orders

Let your attention to detail be as precise as a Jedi’s lightsaber. The future of the Resistance’s circuits depends on this document. May your BOM be accurate, available, and affordable.

**May the Source Be With You.**
