### Project Description

This project combines two advanced real-world FPGA applications on a single platform: **B-mode ultrasound imaging** and **16-QAM digital communication**.
You will build Verilog modules for both applications and simulate/test them using Vivado/ISE and ModelSim.
Ultrasound signal processing includes beamforming, quadrature demodulation, envelope detection, and log compression.
For communication, a full 16-QAM system is developed using LUT-based modulators/demodulators and phase accumulators.
Data output via UART/SPI will allow real-time streaming of ultrasound scans and QAM symbol recovery on a host PC using Python/MATLAB GUI.
This integrated project emphasizes DSP techniques, FPGA toolchains, and real-time interfacing.
