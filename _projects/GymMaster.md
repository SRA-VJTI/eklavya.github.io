### Project Description

This project involves building a solid theoretical foundation in RL concepts, implementing key algorithms like Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo Methods and Policy Gradient Methods, and applying them to different tasks.
By experimenting with advanced techniques such as Double DQN and Actor-Critic methods, you will optimize agent performance and analyze results.
Comprehensive documentation and evaluation will enhance learning and provide insights for future applications, making this project a stepping stone to mastering RL.
