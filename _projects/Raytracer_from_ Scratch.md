### Project Description

The project's goal is to create a ray tracer from scratch and apply it to a scene that has been optimized with graphics programming (CUDA) and displayed with OpenGL. This project employs ray tracing mathematics, implemented in a CUDA kernel for optimal speed, to implement shadows, reflections, and textures. It then applies the texture to an OpenGL-rendered scene.An interactive introduction to graphics programming and ray tracing is provided by this project.
