### Project Description

Have you ever heard of micromouse? It is a small, autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve mazes quickly. This exciting project will allow you to showcase your skills in control systems, graph algorithms, embedded C, and PCB design.

The goal of the project is to develop a custom PCB that can optimize your robot's performance, enabling it to navigate and solve mazes with ease. By implementing a PID controller, you can ensure that your robot has precise movement and control, making real-time adjustments with the help of sensors and feedback mechanisms.

But that's not all - to achieve high-speed maze-solving, you'll need to use the flood-fill algorithm. This algorithm allows your micromouse to explore the maze systematically, determining the shortest path through it and taking your project to the next level.

So, get ready to embark on an exciting journey of designing and building your own high-speed maze-solving micromouse robot. Who knows, you might just end up creating the next big thing in the world of robotics!
