### Project Description
In this project, you will write IP (intellectual property) core for HDMI interfacing with FPGA, we will use TMDS encoding for it. Furthermore, OV7670 Camera Module will be interfaced for Video/Image capturing and Video/Image processing algorithms like Contour detection will be applied to footage.
