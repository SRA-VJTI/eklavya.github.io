### Project Description

Turn a pre-trained **T5** model into a grammar-fixing engine:  
* Clean and pair error-annotated sentences from FCE or Lang-8.  
* Fine-tune T5 with Hugging Face Transformers on Google Colab GPUs.  
* Measure quality with GLEU, precision, recall, and F1.  
* Wrap the model in a lightweight FastAPI service so users can POST text and get corrected output.  
Optional extras include batch endpoints, ONNX/quantized inference, and WandB experiment tracking.
