### Project Description


Explores the design and flight of ornithopters—bird-like flying machines inspired by nature and detailed on ornithopter.org.<br>
Work is divided into mechanical design, simulation, electronics, and rapid prototyping.<br>
Designs include a flapping mechanism, wing structure, and body frame optimized for thrust, control, and ease of 3D printing and assembly.<br>
Simulations run in ANSYS for structural analysis and Gazebo for flight behavior testing.<br>
Electronics cover microcontroller selection, sensors, motors, RF communication, and a space-efficient PCB layout.<br>
Weekly prototyping cycles test ideas, reveal issues, and drive rapid, iterative improvement.<br>
Brings together bio-inspired flight, cross-disciplinary engineering, and hands-on system development.
