### Project Description

The AutoPort project aims to develop a system of two autonomous robots capable of collaboratively navigating an indoor environment, performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), detecting and identifying boxes with ArUco markers, and simultaneously delivering them to a designated drop-off location.<br>
The system leverages ROS2, SLAM for mapping and localization, Nav2 for path planning, and computer vision for ArUco marker detection to enable swarm robotics functionality, ensuring coordinated operation between the two robots.<br>
