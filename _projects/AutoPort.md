### Project Description

AutoPort is an indoor autonomous delivery robot designed to navigate complex environments without manual control.<br>
Uses ROS2 for system integration, SLAM for mapping and localization, and Nav2 for autonomous path planning.<br>
Equipped with LIDAR, camera, and IMU for real-time obstacle detection and localization.<br>
Features a compact 2WD/4WD mobile base with a servo-controlled delivery tray.<br>
Learns and saves maps of indoor spaces for consistent, multi-session navigation.<br>
Final goal is reliable, point-to-point object delivery triggered via user input.<br>
Combines robotics, computer vision, and embedded systems into a practical solution.
