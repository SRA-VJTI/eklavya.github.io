SRA’s taken you from **Inception** to **MARIO**, diving into programming, embedded systems, ROS, OpenCV, and hands-on hardware.  
Now it’s time to put that hard-earned knowledge to the test.

### How it works

**Round 1 – Logic-Building & Technical Challenge**  
  •  Team up in pairs and crack a set of tasks drawn straight from the workshops.  
  •  Score high enough and you move on.

**Round 2 – Interview**  
  •  Walk us through your solutions and pitch a summer project idea.  
  •  Impress the panel and you’re in the EKLAVYA 2025 cohort.
