SRA has organized workshops throughout the year, from Inception to MARIO, covering topics such as C++/Python programming, embedded systems, ROS (Robot Operating System), OpenCV (Image Processing), interesting theory (meh), and hands-on hardware experience. Now it's time to apply all you've learned from these sessions to your own research level projects.

EKLAVYA offers you the opportunity to work on projects in a variety of fields while being mentored by your seniors for two months. Here's a link to all projects and their related websites.

Whether you are applying for an internship or simply seeking to boost your profile to brag to your friends, the level of projects you complete during your undergraduate studies gives you an advantage, and executing a project at the conclusion of your first year is a significant accomplishment.

How can we participate in this mentorship program?

Here's the procedure for the program:

1. Logic building and technical round:
Here you will get tasks with a defined problem statement and youâ€™ll have to solve it with knowledge you gained from the workshops.
For this round you need a team of two members.
TIP: Try to have a teammate who has access to SRA board as it might come handy for the tasks 
Top performers in this round will go for the next round

2. Interview round

3. Commencement of Eklavya

So, when is the technical round?

First round starts from 10th June and ends on 17th June.

What preparations should I do for the first round

1. Go through <a href='https://linktr.ee/EKLAVYA2k24'>SRA exclusive resources</a>, i.e. ppts from workshops and assignments
Note: assignments will be prioritized in your selections as well, so do attempt all the incomplete assignments from all workshops

And that's it!  ðŸ˜¤

You need to register for the mentorship program before the commencement of selection rounds with a cool team ðŸ˜Ž
